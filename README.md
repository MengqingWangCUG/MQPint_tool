# MQPint_tool

MQPint_tool is a self-developed Python script by Mengqing Wang, designed for use in conjunction with pmagpy to process, calculate, and visualize paleomagnetic directional and paleointensity data . The tool aims to improve the efficiency of data analysis in paleomagnetic studies.

Key features include:

Generating standard plots such as Arai plots, Zijderveld diagrams, and Equal area plot;

Built-in support for the RESET  method to enable reliable visualization and computation of paleointensity results.

Note: This tool is intended for personal research use and is still under active development. It requires integration with pmagpy for full functionality.
